Would You Rather?

## Project Overview
This project was built using React-Redux for learning purposes, as part of UDACITY React Nanodegree.
 
The "Would You Rather?" Project, is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. 
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, after logging in, the players are able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
